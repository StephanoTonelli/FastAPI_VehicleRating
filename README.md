# Vehicle Scoring API

A lightweight, high-performance Vehicle Scoring REST API built with FastAPI.
This project provides endpoints to score individual or batch vehicle data based on simple business rules.

> **Note:** The scoring logic implemented in this API is **fictitious** and is intended only for demonstrating the API structure and functionality.

## How to Run Locally (Uvicorn)

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
   - `--reload` enables hot-reloading during development.

3. **Access the API Documentation**
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
     
   - Use the Swagger UI page to **test** all available endpoints easily by sending requests directly from the browser.
   - **Authorization:** Click on the "Authorize" button to input your `X-API-Key` before testing endpoints.

## How to Build and Run with Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t vehicle-scoring-api .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 80:80 vehicle-scoring-api
   ```

3. **Access the API**
   - Navigate to:
     http://localhost/docs
     
   - Use the Swagger UI to interact with and test the API endpoints inside the container.

## System Overview

| Layer                  | Components                          | Purpose                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **API Layer**          | `main.py`, `routers/scoring.py`     | Exposes REST API endpoints          |
| **Schema Layer**       | `schemas.py`                         | Validates and structures data       |
| **Business Logic Layer** | `scoring_logic.py`                | Implements the in-memory scoring rules based on CSV variables |
| **Security Layer**     | `authentication.py`, `data/api_keys.csv` | Manages API key authentication |
| **Logging Layer**      | `models_log.py`, `LoggingMiddleware`, `logs.db` | Logs all incoming requests including client name, response, status, and headers |
| **Infrastructure**     | `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`       | Prepares the app for containerized deployment |

## Notes

- Scoring rules are dynamically loaded from `app/data/scoring_variables.csv`, based on vehicle make and model.
- No default values are used: if the make and model combination is not found, an error will be raised.
- API Key authentication is managed via a **CSV file (`api_keys.csv`)**, and includes the client's name.
- The `client_name` is also logged alongside each request for auditing.
- Request logs are automatically recorded to `logs.db`, including timestamp, status code, headers, response body (truncated), and client name.
- OpenAPI documentation is automatically generated at `/docs` when you run the app.
- **Reminder:** Scoring calculations are **artificial and intended only for demo/testing purposes**.

## How the Scoring System Works

1. **CSV-Driven Variables**
   - The `scoring_variables.csv` file defines scoring multipliers for each vehicle make and model.
   - Example format:
     ```csv
     variable,Toyota_Camry,Honda_Civic,Ford_F150
     age_weight,1.7,1.6,2.0
     mileage_bonus,0.015,0.012,0.008
     engine_size_bonus,0.1,0.05,0.2
     ```

2. **When scoring a vehicle:**
   - The system looks for a column matching `Make_Model` (e.g., `Toyota_Camry`).
   - If found, it applies the corresponding weights to:
     - Age of the vehicle
     - Mileage (rewarding lower mileage)
     - Engine size
   - If not found, a 422 error is raised.

3. **Calculation Example:**
   - Age contribution = (Current Year - Vehicle Year) * `age_weight`
   - Mileage contribution = (100,000 - Mileage) * `mileage_bonus`
   - Engine size contribution = Engine Size * `engine_size_bonus`

## How to Call the API via Postman

1. **Set Up Your Request**
   - Method: `POST`
   - URL for single scoring:
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/score/single

2. **Set Headers**
   - Key: `Content-Type`, Value: `application/json`
   - Key: `X-API-Key`, Value: `<your-api-key-here>` (example: `abc123`)

3. **Set Body** (raw JSON)
   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "make": "Toyota",
     "model": "Camry",
     "year": 2020,
     "mileage": 50000,
     "engine_size": 2.5
   }
   ```

4. **Send the Request**
   - You should receive a JSON response with the vehicle's score.

**Important:** Make sure your `api_keys.csv` contains the API key you are using and that the expiration date has not passed. Also ensure the `make_model` exists in the `scoring_variables.csv`.

## How to Inspect Logs in `logs.db`

### Option 1: DB Browser for SQLite
- Download: https://sqlitebrowser.org/
- Open `logs.db`
- Navigate to `Browse Data` → Table: `request_logs`

### Option 2: SQLite CLI
```bash
sqlite3 logs.db
.tables
SELECT * FROM request_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
.exit
```

### Option 3: View from Python
```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

conn = sqlite3.connect("logs.db")
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM request_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC", conn)
print(df.head())
```
